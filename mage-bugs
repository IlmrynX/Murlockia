# Mage Bugs #

- Ring of Frost moves with the Mage, and probably with other players.
- Ring of Frost-Duration is too long (10Sec instead of 8Sec.)
- Ring of Frost doesn't brake, when damage has been dealt onto the target.
- Sheep doesn't break, when damage has been dealt onto the target.
- Sheep can't be avoided with Shadow Word: Death.
- Pyroblast-Procc doesn't disappear after the first Pyroblast used.
